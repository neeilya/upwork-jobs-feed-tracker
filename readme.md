The Upwork jobs feed tracker is a Chrome extension.  
It allows you to track your personal jobs feed on Upwork  
and immediately notifies you whenever new job appears.

### Download

Feedback and contribute are highly appreciated!

## Warning to freelancers
**This extension retrieves items from your personal job feed**.  
If you are new freelancer on the platform, you might have empty  
jobs feed at the beginning. To personalize your job feed you have to  
make regular jobs search with some criteria like keyword or  
minimum budget and then save it (see screenshot)
